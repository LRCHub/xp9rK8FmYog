Oo, merry Christmas, Santa only comes this time each year, oooo
Well, way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year working out on his sled
It's a little Saint Nick, it's a little Saint Nick

Just a little bobsled, calls it old Saint Nick
But he sparks the buggy with a full speed stick
He's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel
Then he gives gas and just watch him peel, yeah
It's a little Saint Nick, it's a little Saint Nick

Run run reindeer, run run reindeer, run run reindeer
Run run reindeer, run run run, yeah!

He's rolling through the snow at a frightful speed
With a half dozen deer with Rudy to lead
He's gotta wear his goggle cause the snow really flies
And he's cruising every path with a little surprise
It's a little Saint Nick, it's a little Saint Nick

Oo, merry Christmas, Santa only comes this time each year
(Run run run run reindeer!)
Oo, merry Christmas, Santa only comes this time each year
(Run run run run reindeer!)
Oo, merry Christmas, Santa only comes this time each year
(Run run run run reindeer!) all right, that's nice. Sorry
