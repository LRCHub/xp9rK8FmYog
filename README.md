Ooo Merry Christmas Santa
Christmas comes this time
each year Ooo ooo
Well way up North
where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas
that you've all been told
And a real famous cat
all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year
working out on his sled
It's the little Saint Nick
little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick
little Saint Nick
Just a little bobsled
we call it Old Saint Nick
But she'll walk a tobogan
with a four speed stick
She's candy apple red
with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas man
just watch her peel
It's the little Saint Nick
little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick
little Saint Nick
run run reindeer
run run reindeer Whoaa
run run reindeer
run run reindeer
He don't miss no one
And hauling through the snow
at a frightening speed
With a half a dozen deer
with a-Rudy to lead
He's gotta wear his goggles
cause the snow really flies
And he's cruising every pad
with a little surprise
It's the little Saint Nick
little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick
little Saint Nick Ah Ooo
Merry Christmas Santa
Christmas comes this time
each year Ah Ooo
Merry Christmas Santa
Christmas comes this time
each year Ah Ooo
Merry Christmas Santa
Christmas comes this time
each year
